# Pre-Match Data Tennis Prediction Model

For my M.S capstone project, I decided to take a Machine Learning Approach to predicting tennis matches. A large thanks to Jeff Sackmann for hosting an open-source tennis dataset and Nick Devin for his intricate pandas wizardry when it came to building some of the metrics.

For more information on the project, visit the final_report folder to view the paper and presentation. I recieved a 94/100 overall on the project. Overall, this project was an excellent way to understand the practical nuances that come with applying complex non-parametric models to real world data. I'm excited to continue tweaking with this algorithm and adding as time goes on.
